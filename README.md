# SR6-Combat-Tool
Utility for Shadowrun GMs to make running games a bit easier.

Disclaimer - As should be completely obvious from looking at the source code (and this repository) I am not a professional programmer (nor do I know much about git). I am a long-time SR GM, and this tool is what I've put together to make it a bit easier for me to run my games. Hopefully others will find it useful. Feel free to contribute fixes/patches. I'll learn my way around all this evntually. Please be patient...and merciful. If this goes well, I'll also post my little die-roller utility, and anything else I put together.

This uses the Marsenne Twister random number generator, from Dick van Oudheusden, under GPL 2.0. A very nice piece of code that I use for the dice rolling routines.
