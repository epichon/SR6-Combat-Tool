/* This is the controller for the array of actors. It's a little more complicated than usual, because we
 effectively have two different types of selections to worry about:
 - The selection - as in, what array controllers normally deal with, the row in the table that the user has clicked on.
 - The active entry - the active actor is the actor whose turn it is in a combat. The controls about making "active" are about shifting this bit about. It's tracked
   as the indexActiveActor and activeActorObject. Could probably just go by the object, but it works, and I'm not touching it.
 - The selection is handled by the built in methods, with the "Active" bit overlaid.
 
 The ActorArrayController also handles the table of statuses as a data source and delegate.
 
 This was originally written for SR4, where initiative was a lot more complicated, so there may be some echoes of that in how this is structured.
 I'm more-or-less self-taught for Cocoa, so there are probably much more efficient ways to do things, but it's what I could figure out.
