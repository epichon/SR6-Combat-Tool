 This is the dice roller object, for SR6. It includes the various new edge-rolling options that are in SR6, with hooks for UIs to determine what roll options
 are avialable. Rather than selecting individual die to modify, you just say what kind of die you would like to modify, and the roller handles it from there,
 selecting an appropriate die. the _analyze method is where most of the smarts are - it parses the results, determines what they are, and what reroll/modify
 optiosn are available with the current set of dice.
